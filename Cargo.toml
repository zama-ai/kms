# The backward-compatibility module is excluded from the workspace in order to avoid dependency
# conflicts. This is related to the fact that it needs to import the different packages (kms,
# threshold-fhe) to test with specific versions when generating the data. However, the
# workspace already has these dependencies by nature, creating a name conflict like described in
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12891
# Note that it's not possible to only generate the lock file using specific features as the resolver
# builds the graph as if all features are enabled:
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#features
