### What is KMS
The Zama KMS is a fully decentralized key management solution for TFHE, more specifically [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs), based on a maliciously secure and robust [MPC protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/815).

The system facilitates this through the use of a blockchain which provides a means of fulfilling payments to the MPC parties, along with providing an immutable audit log.

Interaction with the same KMS will happen either through an external Ethereum blockchain, providing an API via a smart contract, or through the [fhevm gateway service](https://github.com/zama-ai/gateway-l2).

### Main features
The following describes how the KMS is used in conjunction with fhevm Gateway, including the external components needed.
While the KMS can be used with multiple L1 EVM host chains, for simplicity, we will in the following document assume there is only a single L1 host chain.

At the highest level, the system consists of multiple subsystems: a *host chain*, an *fhevm Gateway* and a *KMS*. The KMS is in turn composed of the following components, which we illustrate in the pictures below.

![KMS system](./docs/getting-started/overview.png)

We observe that while the standard deployment of the KMS system is in a threshold setting. It can also be deployed in a centralized manner, where it will consist of a single logical Connector, Core and Keychain DA.
For more details we direct the reader to [the architecture section](https://github.com/zama-ai/tech-spec/tree/main/architecture) of the tech spec.

### Implementation

The KMS is implemented as a gRPC service using the [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) crate.
Communication to the KMS Core service is done using gRPC and is defined by [protobuf](./core/grpc/proto/) messages.
The rest of the communication is defined by existing standards and uses JSON-RPC.

### Directory overview

- `common`
    - Utility code and macros shared between other source code folders.
- [`observability`](./observability/README.md)
    - Code and documentation related to open telemetry tracing; in particular in the situation where multiple KMS Core nodes are running on separate physical machines.

    - `backup`
        - Code related to doing encrypted backups of the confidential material constructed by the threshold protocols.
    - [`grpc`](./core/grpc/README.md)
        - Protobuf files, API documentation and type conversion files (based on the protobuf) which defines the external interface of a KMS Core.

    - [`threshold`](./core/threshold/README.md)
        - The code implementing the MPC protocols executing decryption, CRS and key generation, along with server code used by the MPC protocols to communicate together.
    - [`core-client`](./core-client/README.md)
        - Code for the CLI client that can be used to manually interact with the KMS Cores.
    - `docker`
        - Docker files used to containerize the different binaries in the KMS Core, e.g. the Core Service, Threshold Server and KMS Connector.
    - [`docs`](./docs/README.md)
        - High level documentation of the KMS Core system.
    - [`observability`](./observability/README.md)
        - Folder containing code, configurations and scripts for observability, such as through prometheus, grafana and loki.


## Installation
Docker images that are ready for use can be found [here](https://github.com/zama-ai/kms-core/packages).
Ensure that you have access to the required Docker images:
  - Either use [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or go to your GitHub, click you profile picture, select "Settings". Then navigate to "Developer Settings" > "Personal Access Tokens" > "Tokens (classic)" > "Generate new token (classic)". The token should have the "read:packages" permission. Afterwards, do `docker login ghcr.io` and use your github ID and the token to login. Note that this token is saved by docker locally in the clear, so it's best to only give it the permissions you need and set the expiration time to a short period of time.

## Getting started
The project requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to be installed and running, along with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with version >= 1.86, the [protobuf compiler, `protoc`](https://protobuf.dev/installation/), [pkgconfig](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf), and [openssl](https://openssl-library.org/).
Ensure that these are installed on your system.

The project can be build with:
```bash
cargo build
```

Typical testing can be done using
```bash
cargo test
```
Some integration tests may require the use of additional tools. In particular some tests require Redis to be running on the local system. Further details can be found in the READMEs in each sub project. To avoid them and only run unit tests, run the following command instead:
```bash
cargo test --lib
```

To run the full test-suite (which may take several hours) run the tests with the `slow_tests` feature:
```bash
cargo test -F slow_tests
```

## Working with the KMS

### Disclaimers

#### Audits
The Zama KMS has not yet been audited and should be considered in the alpha stage. Known bugs and security issues are present as reflected by issue tracking.
However, it is currently in the process of being audited.

#### Parameters
The default parameters for the Zama KMS are chosen to ensure a failure probability of 2^-64 and symmetric equivalent security of 128 bits.

#### Side-channel attacks

Mitigation for side-channel attacks has not been implemented directly in the Zama KMS. The smart contract of the blockchain from which calls originate is responsible to ensure the validity of calls. In particular that new ciphertexts are correctly constructed (through a proof-of-knowledge).
