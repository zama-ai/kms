### Dependency Update Questionnaire (only if deps changed or added)
Answer in the `Cargo.toml` next to the dependency (or here if updating):
1. Ownership changes or suspicious concentration?
2. Low popularity?
3. Unusual version jump?
4. Lacking documentation?
5. Missing CI?
6. No security / disclosure policy?
7. Significant size increase?
