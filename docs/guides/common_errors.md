# Common Deployment Errors

## Deployment Errors

### Out of Memory error

**Error message**: Out of Memory error, OOMKilled

**Cause**: The server doesn't have enough memory.

**Possible solutions**: Use a more powerful server. Currently, we use `hpc7a` machines for some of our benchmarks, with 192 cores and 768 GB RAM. A machine like an `c7i.metal-24xl` with 96 cores and 192 GB RAM is also fine for most cases.

### Server crash with code 137

**Error message**: 
```bash
dev-kms-core-1-1 exited with code 137
```

**Cause**: Docker does not have enough memory.

**Possible solutions**: Your local Docker instance is not setup to use enough memory. This typically happens if you have not manually changed the settings to ensure it has 24 GB available.

### No space left on device

**Error message**: No space left on device

**Cause**: The server doesn't have enough disk space.

**Possible solutions**: Increase the disk capacity of your instance.

### Error related to PRSS setup

**Error message**:

```bash
No PRSS setup exists
```

**Cause**: The threshold servers have not executed the init step to ensure that preprocessed material is there. This should be done automatically by the CI or via docker compose during the launch process, but can also be done manually from the CI core/service/src/bin/kms-init.rs. However, be aware that this must be done for all parties at the same time.

**Possible solutions**: Run a command like this:

```bash
kms-init --addresses http://kms-threshold-1-threshold-core_kms-threshold_svc_50100.mesh:80 http://kms-threshold-2-threshold-core_kms-threshold_svc_50100.mesh:80 http://kms-threshold-3-threshold-core_kms-threshold_svc_50100.mesh:80 http://kms-threshold-4-threshold-core_kms-threshold_svc_50100.mesh:80
```

You can also face this error message regarding PRSS:

```bash
WARN kms_lib::threshold::threshold_kms: failed to read PRSS from file with error: No such file or directory (os error 2)
INFO kms_lib::threshold::threshold_kms: Initializing threshold KMS server without PRSS Setup, remember to call the init GRPC endpoint
```

**Cause**: The PRSS Setup file should be stored under `keys/PRIV-pX/PrssSetup/000..0001` in `PRIV-pX`  (where `pX` refers to the parties `p1`, `p2`, etc.). It is not located there or is corrupted.

**Possible solutions**: Check the PRSS Setup file location and make sure it is correct, possibly re-run PRSS-init.


## Development Errors

### Too many files error

**Error message**:

```bash
Too many open files
```

**Cause**: Not enough file descriptors.

**Possible solutions**: Increase the number of allowed file descriptors by adding the `ulimit -n 1024` statement to your bash profile.

### Result of decryption is incorrect

**Error message**: "Error in public decryption", "Could not reconstruct decryption result", or similar.

**Cause**: This happened once because the public key being used was not the proper pair of the private key being deployed. Do not rely on the name of the key to make sure that you have a proper pair.

**Possible solutions**: In this case make sure to use the right keys, e.g. by copying the public key from the adequate place (S3 bucket, Docker container, Kubernetes pod, etc.)
